			<p>I'm going to break this post down into sections to help you understand my workflow, how I manage time, and the apps I use. I'll be creating updated versions of this post in the future as I find new ways to improve.</p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<h3>Productivity and Time Management</h3>

				<p>Most people seem to think that they can manage everything in their head and that writing down your tasks seems mundane and useless. I'm here to tell you that simply isn't the case.</p>
				
				<p> First off, let me stress the fact that if you think of something that needs to be done, and it takes under 5 minutes to complete the task -- <strong>DO IT IMMEDIATELY!!</strong> Read that 5 times so it <em>really</em> sticks.</p>

				<p>If it takes longer than 5 minutes, always write down the task as soon as you realize something needs to be done. You can use good ol' pen and paper, but I'm often on the go, so I use a free app called <a href="http://wunderlist.com" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a>. It's available for all platforms and auto syncs across devices.</p>

				<p>I like to organize my tasks by each specific project I'm currently working on, then list tasks under each project name. Some people list their projects by type, i.e. Design, Front-End, etc. I find it much more useful to <strong>not</strong> do it that way. (I've tried both.) Try to be as specific as possible when creating tasks.</p>

				
				<h3>Design</h3>
				
				<p>This is my design flow - start to finish, as well as some tips and pointers.</p>

				<h4>Wireframing</h4>

				<p>I've seen a lot of designers that tend to skip the whole wireframing process. I personally think it is one of the most important steps in design, especially when doing work with a (picky) client.</p>

				<p>If you're a designer and don't have <a href="http://creativemarket.com" target="_blank">Creative Market</a> and <a href="http://pixeden.com" target="_blank">Pixeden</a> bookmarked, then go ahead and smack yourself, because you've been missing out. You'll find all kinds of wireframing templates and mock-ups to use there.</p>

				<p>If the project you're designing for is something rather new to you (design wise), print out some browser or mobile templates and doodle on those first to get started. It's important to use a thick stroke marker during this step. You might think a pencil is better, but you want to focus on the layout -- <strong>not</strong> little details.</p>

				<p>Once you (and your client) are happy with what's on paper, get in Photoshop or Illustrator and start going into a bit finer detail. You can use wireframing component packs or make your own.</p>

				<h4>Photoshop</h4>

				<p>I'd really like to recommend the Plugins from the awesome guys over at <a href="https://madebysource.com/#products" target="_blank">Source</a>. My personal favorite is <a href="http://getenigma64.com/" target="_blank">Enigma64</a> -- it will save you <em>loads</em> of time exporting png and jpg images from Photoshop. They also have a great <a href="https://madebysource.com/academy/photoshop-tips/" target="_blank">video</a> to help you configure Photoshop, and check out Mark Bjango's' <a href="http://bjango.com/articles/photoshop/" target="_blank">article</a> on color management for Photoshop.</p>

				<p>Another useful thing to do, especially when collaborating with a team, is to define a set structure for your Groups and Layers within Photoshop. I personally like to use the following structure:</p>

				<p>// GROUP //<br>. layer</p>
				
				<p>I recommend naming your groups/layers the same as your id/class tags in css. That way it's easier to navigate and relate to, especially when someone other than yourself opens the PSD or stylesheet.</p>

				<h4>Image Optimization</h4>

				<p>As I stated earlier, I always use <a href="http://getenigma64.com/" target="_blank">Enigma64</a> to export my png and jpeg images from Photoshop. I export at the highest quality possible, and then run the images through <a href="http://imageoptim.com/" target="_blank">ImageOptim</a>. If you're on Windows, you can use <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Editors/Shrink-O-Matic.shtml" target="_blank">Shrink O'Matic</a>.</p>

				<h4>Skala Preview</h4>

				<p>If you're on Mac and design mobile apps, <a href="http://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview//" target="_blank">Skala Preview</a> will be your new best friend. Once connected, it will wirelessly update whatever is in your PSD to your Android or iOS device. This way as you design your app, you get a live preview of exactly what it will look like on the device. It's pure magic.</p>

				<h3>Front-End</h3>

				<p>For front end development, I use liquid templating and css preprocessing.</p>

				<h4>Mixture</h4>

				<p><a href="http://mixture.io" target="_blank">Mixture</a> is hands down the best front-end development tool on the market. I <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommend you check it out. It has boilerplates, preprocessing, live refresh on all devices, templating, data models, server publishing, auto minification and more.</p>

				<p>You can also connect your <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account to Mixture, and auto push to gh pages with the click of a button. I could go on and on about how awesome Mixture is, but just go check it out for yourself.</p>

				<h4>Liquid Templating</h4>

				<p>Another built in feature of Mixture is the <a href="http://docs.mixture.io/templates" target="_blank">Liquid Template Engine</a>. It's similar to HTML, but adds much more functionality and power over raw HTML. I suggest you use Liquid if you use Mixture.</p>

				<h4>Bootstrap / LESS</h4>

				<p>A lot of front-end developers that use <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> seem to link the complete Bootstrap stylesheet, then also link their own custom stylesheet with overrides. There is a much better way to implement Bootstrap, and it reqiures getting familiar with the <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">LESS</a> dynamic stylesheet language.</p>

				<p>If you use Mixture, you can just download the bootstrap boilerplate when creating a new project, or download Bootstrap with the LESS files directly from Bootstrap's website. If you know CSS, then learning LESS will be a piece of cake, and you will be amazed by how much time it saves you. The LESS website has docs to get you started.</p>

				<p>Using LESS with Bootstrap will make your front-end footprint much smaller. If you don't need a certain component of bootstrap, just remove the @import in bootstrap.less. Once you have all the components picked out that you'll need, you can edit them directly, along with the variables. The only downside to this, is that if Bootstrap has an update that changes a lot of things, it will be harder to implement that update.</p>

				<p>I would argue that the smaller file size is more important, especially on high-trafficed sites. I don't see bootstrap coming out with feature changes that would force you to have to update to the newest version. If that were the case however, you would probably need to rebuild a lot of the HTML anyway, so again LESS wins.</p>

				<h4>Sublime Text</h4>

				<p>My code editor of choice is <a href="http://sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>. I use the Monokai color theme, except I've modified the background to be a bit darker (#222). I also have the UI of the app reskinned with <a href="http://buymeasoda.github.io/soda-theme/" target="_blank">Soda Dark</a>. Don't forget the <a href="http://emmet.io" target="_blank">Emmet</a> plugin to write html & css a <strong>lot</strong> faster. For more tips & tricks, check out this <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank">article</a> from Tutsplus.</p>

				<h3>Misc</h3><br>

				<h4>BetterSnapTool</h4>

				<p>If you're on Mac, check out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12" target="_blank">BetterSnapTool</a>. It allows you to drag apps into sections you define to quickly resize windows. I have it set up to quickly get the browser on the left of the screen, and Sublime Text on the remaining space on the right.</p>
